## Recommended RuneLite Notification Settings
![image](https://github.com/adamk33n3r/runelite-watchdog/assets/1350444/18eb10dd-9ddb-4248-9d5f-ddc335acc103)

Request Focus should be set to `Off` otherwise you will get some wrong behaviors with your background notifications.

## Examples

## Alert Hub
Add alerts other users have shared directly from the panel! You can check out the [alert hub branch](https://github.com/adamk33n3r/runelite-watchdog/tree/alert-hub) to learn how to upload your own.

## Capture Groups
Capture groups can make your alerts dynamic by changing the output depending on what triggered the alert.

Any trigger with a text input can use `{}` to create a capture group around the text inside it. You can then use the
captured text in your alert output by writing `$1`. Multiple brackets can be read sequentially with `$2`, `$3` etc.
This is useful when using glob [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)), since the text that was
globbed can now be captured with `{*}`. 

Say you have a Notification Fired Alert with the Message set to `Your {*} is ready to harvest in {*}`. 
You could then have a TTS notification set to `Go get your $1 in $2!` which would make it say something like
`Go get your Ranarr in Ardougne!`.

Another useful output is as the file name for a sound notification. With the above example, we could set the alert
to play `$1.wav`, which would actually play other files in the same folder such as `ranarr.wav` and `torstol.wav`.
To set this up, you have to include and select a dummy file `$1.wav` in the folder with the files you wish to use,
even though the file itself will not be played.

With [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) enabled, you instead use parenthesis `()` to surround the text you wish to capture.
